        If there's a back button, we need to account for its space on the left to keep the title truly centered.
        However, with flex-1 on the title and symmetrical placeholders/buttons, text-center should suffice.
        The pr-10 was to offset the back button's width if the title wasn't flex-1.
        With flex-1 and a placeholder on the right (or another button), text-center works well.

  }

  <!--
    Optional: Add a placeholder or an actions slot on the right if needed
    to perfectly balance the title when the back button is present.
    For now, flex-1 on the title and text-center should handle most cases.
    If you had right-side actions, you'd add another div here.
